## IV. Insights
- A profit margin of 40% is a good profitability indicator for this sales sector.
- The United States currently has the largest sales volume, accounting for 60% of the total market capacity, and also has half of the total number of stores. The countries' contributions to sales are quite proportional to the number of stores they have.
- Online sales yield better profits.
- Bikes are the best-selling category, contributing 80% of the total profit, and the United States is the country that uses bikes the most, accounting for nearly 45% of the total sales volume.
- The United States: The number one country in terms of consumption, quantity, and customers. However, in terms of profit per person, the European market generates three times the profit of the United States.
- The Bikes category has the largest inventory value of 24M (70%), nearly 4 times higher than the Components industry (9M). 
- The European market yields the highest profit, but the shipping costs are excessively high.

## V. Recommendations
- The ability to distribute and produce products needs to be maintained.
- Strengthen the online sales channel.
- Enhance marketing, increase the number of stores, and run robust promotional campaigns to attract more customers.
